# 3D Graphics Renderer
[github.com/adam-ayan/3d-graphics-renderer]

- Ongoing C++ app processing 3D vertex input data to display images of constructed polyhedra.
- Implements core vector math (dot, cross products) and early-stage rendering pipeline architecture.
- Rendering pipeline built bottom-up from scratch; OpenGL used only to display final 2D image.
- Development environment containerized with Docker for consistent builds and testing.
- Demonstrates skills in bottom-up graphics programming, computational geometry, linear algebra, and system design.
