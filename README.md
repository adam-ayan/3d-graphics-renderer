# \# 3D Graphics Renderer

# 

# \*\*Status:\*\* Ongoing

# 

# A C++ project for processing 3D vertex input data to construct and display polyhedra images using a bottom-up graphics pipeline.

# 

# \*\*\*

# 

# \## Project Overview

# 

# This project explores the fundamental principles of 3D graphics programming, computational geometry, and linear algebra by building a rendering engine from scratch. It emphasizes understanding low-level mechanics rather than relying entirely on high-level graphics libraries. OpenGL is used only to display the final 2D image.

# 

# \## Goals

# 

# \- Develop a robust, bottom-up understanding of 3D graphics rendering

# \- Implement core vector and matrix operations for transformations, projections, and lighting

# \- Build a modular system architecture that can be expanded to support additional rendering techniques

# \- Showcase proficiency in C++17 features including object-oriented design, templates, and memory management

# \- Demonstrate technical depth through practical application of mathematics in programming
