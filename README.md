\# 3D Graphics Renderer



\*\*Status:\*\* Ongoing



A C++ project for processing 3D vertex input data to construct and display polyhedra images using a bottom-up graphics pipeline.



\## Project Overview



This project explores the fundamental principles of 3D graphics programming, computational geometry, and linear algebra by building a rendering engine from scratch. It emphasizes understanding low-level mechanics rather than relying entirely on high-level graphics libraries. OpenGL is used solely to display the final 2D image.



\## Goals



\- Develop a robust, bottom-up understanding of 3D graphics rendering.

\- Implement core vector and matrix operations to handle transformations, projections, and lighting.

\- Build a modular system architecture that can be expanded to support additional rendering techniques.

\- Showcase proficiency in C++17 features, including object-oriented design, templates, and memory management.

\- Create a portfolio-quality project demonstrating technical depth and practical application of mathematics in programming.



\## Objectives



\- Implement classes and functions for core vector math operations (dot products, cross products, vector normalization).

\- Parse and handle 3D vertex input data efficiently.

\- Construct polyhedra using vertex and face definitions.

\- Apply transformations (translation, scaling, rotation) and project 3D coordinates to 2D.

\- Implement a basic lighting and shading model for realistic rendering.

\- Prepare clear documentation and modular code to facilitate future extensions, such as camera control, texture mapping, or real-time rendering.



\## Highlights



\- Bottom-up rendering pipeline: built from scratch for maximum learning and control.

\- Strong emphasis on computational geometry and linear algebra principles.

\- Modular, readable, and maintainable C++ code structure.

\- Demonstrates the ability to translate mathematical concepts into practical graphics applications.



\## Build / Run



\- Requires a C++17-compatible compiler.

\- Compilation commands and detailed instructions will be added as the project progresses.

\- Currently under active development; some modules may be incomplete.



\## Future Plans



\- Implement additional rendering features such as shading, lighting, and camera controls.

\- Add support for importing standard 3D model formats.

\- Optimize performance for larger polyhedra and more complex scenes.

\- Expand documentation with tutorials and usage examples.
