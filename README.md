# 3D Graphics Renderer

A C++ application that renders 3D polyhedra from vertex input data, supporting multiple file formats, dynamic transformations, and customizable camera perspectives for interactive visualization. The renderer implements core vector math operations (dot, cross, normalization) and a modular rendering pipeline built entirely from scratch, with OpenGL used only for final 2D display.

Tech Stack:
- Language: C++
- Tools: OpenGL (display), Docker (development environment)
- Concepts: Vector math, computational geometry, modular rendering pipeline

Skills:
- Bottom-up graphics programming
- Computational geometry and linear algebra
- System and software architecture
- Reproducible builds and cross-platform testing
- Project organization for maintainable and scalable code

Future Work:
- Implement lighting and shading models
- Add texture mapping support
- Optimize performance for larger models
- Expand renderer for real-time interactive scenes
