# 3D Graphics Renderer
[github.com/adam-ayan/3d-graphics-renderer]

- Ongoing C++ application that processes 3D vertex input data to render accurate images of polyhedra, supporting multiple file formats, dynamic transformations, and customizable camera perspectives for interactive visualization.
- Implements comprehensive core vector math operations including dot, cross, and normalized products, along with an early-stage rendering pipeline designed modularly to allow flexible experimentation with shading, projection, and geometric algorithms.
- Rendering pipeline built entirely from scratch; OpenGL is used exclusively for displaying the final 2D image, giving full control over all stages of graphics computation, from vertex processing to rasterization.
- Development environment containerized with Docker to ensure reproducible builds, facilitate cross-platform testing, and enable isolated experimentation with system dependencies and compiler configurations.
- Future goals include implementing lighting and shading models, adding texture mapping support, optimizing performance for larger models, and expanding the renderer to handle real-time interactive scenes.
- Demonstrates advanced skills in bottom-up graphics programming, computational geometry, linear algebra, system design, modular software architecture, and project organization for maintainable and scalable codebases.
